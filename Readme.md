## Something about myself ;)

 At first, I'm 21 yo, and graduating from university. Now I'm working as a coach in the gym and studing at WebAcademy.

 There are a number of criteria why I chose programming.(given that I have never been interested in this field)

 1. **I don't want _to be tied to one country._**
 2. _This area is constantly evolving._
 3. **There is no salary limit)**
